## Introduction

Statistics are boring, right? Dead wrong, and the purpose of this presentation to show you how regression is as easy as `2 + 2` = ``r 2+2``! 

## `mtcars`

`mtcars` is a dataset from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine which provides automotive measurements of cars at the time. An example of some of these measured variables are:

* Fuel economy;
* Transmission type;
* Engine type.

Below is a brief look into the `mtcars` dataset,

```{r}
kable(head(mtcars, 5), align="c")
```

## The How

Using these variables, my gadget demonstrates the statistical ability to develop prediction models upon the fuel economy variable. 

## The Result

Using an interactive approach to regression, my gadget inspires an interest within learners in statistics.
